# Weather Monitoring System

## Abstract
The Weather Monitoring System is a Python-based application designed to retrieve and process real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides daily weather summaries, alerts for specific conditions, and visualizations of weather trends. The system aims to deliver accurate and timely weather information for enhanced decision-making.

## Description
This application continuously fetches weather data for major metros in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad) at configurable intervals. It processes the data to generate daily summaries, including average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, as well as the dominant weather condition. Users can set alert thresholds for temperature and other conditions, ensuring they receive timely notifications.

## Features
- Real-time weather data retrieval from the OpenWeatherMap API
- Daily weather summaries with aggregates (average, maximum, minimum temperatures)
- User-configurable alert thresholds for specific weather conditions
- Visualization of weather trends and alerts
- Comprehensive test cases to ensure functionality
